When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When im working in various computers or callaborating with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you might need to work in a different computer, and that will mean that you are working on the web.
    You dont want every single bit of work to be pulled out inmediatly to your computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a copy made on the GitHub servers, clones creates a copy of the repository on a local machine, and branches
    are parallel lies of work but they are part of the same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To know the differences that your caollaborators have added and copare them with your changes

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would collaborate using google docs, it will be easier to keep track of a healty version, but we wouldn't be able to
    go back to older versions or to do paraller work, like with branches.
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You want to use different braches because it allos people to collaborate, by ot canging the main file without permission
    and making every commit a group effort.
