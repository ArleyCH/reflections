How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because the bug was due to a bad change. So by looking at the change we find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Understanding the process you follow, its pros and cons.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro will be that you save at the points you think it is relevant.
    The con will be that maybe you will have a hard time to fix the code if the actual one 
    is corrupted.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To create proyects that need various files to work in parallel.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log displays each commit, its date and also the autor.
    diff shows the differences between files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It creates chekpoints automatically.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
